# Unraveling the genetic architecture of autism: a multi-omic approach towards mirror neurons
**Author: Murzi Ana SolFacultad de Ingeniería de la Universidad Nacional de Entre Ríos (FIUNER)**

### Overview

  This project develops the first integrative genomic framework that systematically identifies autism risk genes operating within mirror
  neuron circuits. Through multi-omic analysis combining GWAS data (9.1M variants), eQTL from GTEx v8 consortium, and Bayesian
  colocalization analysis, 215 robust eQTL associations were identified across 5 candidate genes. CACNA1C emerged as the principal gene
  with 136 eQTL variants and maximum colocalization score of 20.52, establishing itself as a priority therapeutic target for directed
  interventions in autism spectrum disorders.

### Key Findings

  **Principal Results**

  * 215 statistically robust eQTL associations across 5 mirror neuron system genes
  * CACNA1C identified as primary therapeutic target (136 eQTLs, score: 20.52)
  * Tissue-specific regulatory patterns across cerebellar, cortical, and limbic regions
  * 100% association survival under strict statistical corrections (FDR + Bonferroni)
  * Over 99% statistical power for effect detection across all analyses

  **Gene Priority Hierarchy**

  1. CACNA1C - 39,292 colocalization tests, maximum score: 20.52
  2. CHD8 - 5,519 tests, score: 12.10
  3. CNTNAP2 - 6,907 tests, score: 10.48
  4. FOXP2 - 7,549 tests, score: 10.24
  5. THEMIS - 432 tests, score: 6.87

  **Methodological Innovations**

  * Integrative multi-omic pipeline combining GWAS-eQTL-colocalization
  * Tissue-specific regulatory network analysis
  * Comprehensive statistical validation framework
  * Reproducible computational workflow
