SCIENTIFICALLY JUSTIFIED COLOCALIZATION METHODOLOGY
============================================================

FACTORS IMPLEMENTED:
1. Statistical Evidence: -log10(p-values) geometric mean
2. Proximity Factor: Exponential decay with genomic distance
3. LD Factor: Proxy based on proximity (real LD data preferred)
5. Effect Size Weight: Magnitude of genetic effects
7. Sample Size Correction: Statistical power adjustment
8. Heterogeneity Penalty: Direction consistency check
9. Formal Coloc Prior: Literature-based priors
10. Neurodevelopmental Relevance: Domain-specific weighting

WEIGHTING SCHEME:
- Statistical Evidence: 25%
- Proximity Factor: 15%
- LD Factor: 10%
- Effect Size: 15%
- Sample Size: 10%
- Heterogeneity: 5%
- Coloc Prior: 10%
- Neurodev Relevance: 10%
